<p>For my MSMS Work Project, I have chosen to create a simulation of the planetary orbits around the Sun using Javascript. With the aid of the <a href="http://threejs.org">three.js</a> library, I was able to create (mostly) accurate 3D models of the ten major astronomical bodies of our solar system. The orbit lines and orbits were also made in three.js.
    <br><i><b>Note:</b> Sizes and speeds of the Sun and the planets have been scaled up by a constant factor to enhance the visualization.</i>
    <br>During the creation of this project, I was able to learn more about Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion (listed below) and how they actually apply to the universe through the math that allowed my planets to simulate their orbits correctly, as well as learning more about and gaining experience in Javascript. Creating this simulator really showed me how vast the Solar System is, especially considering the amount of scaling I had to do in order to get things into view.
    <br><b>Kepler's Laws:</b>
    <br> (i) The orbit of each planet is an ellipse with the Sun as the focal point.
    <br> (ii) Two orbits can cover the same area in the same amount of time.
    <br> (iii) The ratio of the cube from the distance of the Sun to the square of the period of the time it takes for the planet to go around the Sun is constant for all planets.</p>

<p>The Work Project is a key part of the application to be accepted into the Mississippi School of Math and Science. The project has to show a mathmatical and/or scientific concept that you can understand. Not only does it show your knowledge, it shows your skills.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Credits</h3>

<p>Thanks to my dad for helping me out when things got tricky, especially in the math and code. Thank you, MSMS, for giving me the opportunity to exercise my skill in programming, math and science. And a big thank you to all my friends who kept asking "Hey, is your application done yet?" and other such encouragement. ;)</p>
